            <h3>Description</h3>
            <div class="section">
                <p>
                    Cigánypecsenye (pronounced tzi-gany-pe-che-nyeh), or Hungarian Pork Steak Gypsy-Style, is a rustic and flavourful Hungarian dish where tenderized, marinated pork is pan-fried in bacon drippings. Foods cooked in Gypsy-Style are hearty and satisfying, and are a real treat in Hungarian cuisine!

            <h3>Ingridients</h3>
            <div class="section">
                <ul>
                   
                    <li>1 kg pork shoulder blade steak, boneless (or about 4 pieces), See Note (*)</li>
                    <li>½ tsp salt</li>
                    <li>½ tsp ground black pepper</li>
                    <li>1 tsp Hungarian paprika</li>
                    <li>6 garlic cloves</li>
                    <li>250 g smoked bacon (Hungarian smoked bacon preferred, although sometimes difficult to find), See Note (**)</li>
                    <li>½ cup vegetable oil (you may need more for frying depending on size of skillet and how much is absorbed by your meat while cooking)</li>
                    <li>½ cups all-purpose flour (optional)</li>
                                        </ul>
            </div>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <div class="section">
                <ol>
                    <li> each pork steak with a meat tenderizer. Season with salt, pepper, and paprika. Rub both sides with garlic, set aside in the fridge to marinate (about 1 hour).While your pork is marinating, begin cooking your bacon. If using Hungarian bacon, cut a about a 1 inch thick slice and cut bacon in a cockscomb shape (as seen in photo).</li>
                    <li>>In a large skillet, cook your bacon until nice and crispy. Remove bacon from skillet and set aside. Do not discard bacon drippings from skillet.</li>
                    <li>Add oil to same skillet. Heat oil in skillet with leftover bacon drippings.</li>
                    <li>>Optional: If you're going to coat your pork chops in flour, do it now. You can either dredge them in flour, sprinkle some flour over top each side, or omit this step entirely.</li>
                    <li>Place pork steaks in the skillet. Cook pork steaks in bacon drippings and oil, flipping half way through (about 4-7 minutes per side, depending on size and thickness of your meat). If using bone-in shoulder blade steak, you will need to pan-fry it longer, about 7-10 min per side.</li>
                    <li>Serve with bacon on top and a side of potatoes.
